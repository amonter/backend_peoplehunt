 Here are the answers for the inquiring minds:
</div>
 
<div style="padding:10px 0px 10px 0px;">
<b>Who is it for?</b><br>

This is for people from all age groups and genders, 
who would like to keep developing their social skills. Social skills are in a way like exercising our bodies. 
When you stop, it becomes harder and more painful to get back to you previous level. 
On the other hand when you do it constantly, it becomes a fun and challenging activity and you become better at it.
</div>
 
<div style="padding:10px 0px 10px 0px;">
<b>How is it going to work?</b><br>

This workshop is planned to be 3 hrs long. The first half will be spend on theory (building confidence, 
conversational skills, social anxiety and group dynamics). 
The other half will be spend talking to people that you don’t know and get some real life practice.
</div>
 
<div style="padding:10px 0px 10px 0px;">
<b>What are the benefits of talking to Strangers?</b><br>
Well, I can say that the benefits are just far too great. 
Universities and schools never teach us on how to talk to people we have never met before. 
We have developed our own social skills from friends, books, emulation or simply by instinct. 
The benefits involved gaining a big amount of personal confidence and a more fulfilling social life. 
Talking to people you don’t know could easily develop into business connections, networking, meeting new interesting people or simply romance.

</div>
 
<div style="padding:10px 0px 10px 0px;">
<b>Who is giving this workshop?</b><br>
My name is Adrian. I am the founder of meetforeal.com and from my personal experience. 
I have learned so much from talking to strangers. In the past 7 months I have spoken to more than 150 new 
strangers from all regions and nationalities. I have lived in 4 different countries and I speak 3 different languages. 
I have a Masters degree on Computer Science believe it or not. 
I have learned so much from the actual practice and theory that is so much fun. I would like to share all what I have learned.

</div> 


<div style="padding:10px 0px 10px 0px;">
<b>Is it not something you learn anyway?</b><br>

Yes and no at the same time. People usually don’t feel very comfortable talking to people they don’t know very well. 
How about setting a specific goal to talk to a certain amount of people you don’t know? 
This will give you loads of stamina to grow and maintain your social skills muscles. 
Gradually you will feel more confident and comfortable talking to strangers.
</div>

<div style="padding:10px 0px 10px 0px;">
<b>How much does it cost?</b><br>

Its 25 euro for the whole workshop. Please if you are interested send me an email adrian@meetforeal.com,or add it to your events!
