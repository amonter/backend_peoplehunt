    <p>CrowdScanner is an enterprise platform that you can customise for your meeting, event or conference, that takes attendee information, real-time, and generates visuals to display as social objects at your event. CrowdScanner lets people discover <strong>who</strong> they need to be talking to, and <strong>what</strong> to talk to them about. </br></p>

    <div class="tour-content-text" style="width:320px;">
      <p class="tour-intro-paragraph">CrowdScanner gives you the tools to create social objects at your event: objects that captivate the interest of your attendees, and spark conversations between them. </p>
	<p>CrowdScanner social objects are special because they contain attendee information. They act as a soft layer of information, containing the seeds for connection.</p> 
	<p>Just set up a projector and/or LCD screens at your event displaying your attendees answers. People can gather around them, and add themselves real time. It's also a huge incentive for maximum attendee participation.</p>
