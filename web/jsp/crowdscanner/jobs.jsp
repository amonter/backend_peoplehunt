	<p><h1>About us:</h1>
	We are not like any other start-up - we are fully committed to creating impact and changing the world.
	<br><br>We are a hardcore tech company, yet we love the arts. We are passionate about building cool technology that makes users feel awesome.
	<br><br>We build technology that stimulates discussion between people who are in the same physical space, like a conference or event. Our smartphone apps and visual installations enable people to discover one another, and see what they have in common in a serendipitous, fun way.   
<br><br>
	In essence, we are gamifying face to face networking. We design and develop fun and challenging games that encourage self discovery and mutual discovery, which ultimately result in interesting conversations occurring between people who would otherwise not meet. 
 <br><br>We are based in Ireland, mainly in Dublin and Galway, with a presence in the USA, particularly NYC.
<br><br>
We want to build a remarkable team who care about making the world a better place with technology.
